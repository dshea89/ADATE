This directory contains undocumented source code for version 041 of ADATE,
which can run under CHIMP MPI and LINUX on an unlimited number of CPUs. It 
is much more stable than any previous ADATE version and doesn't have known 
bugs. However, error handling and efficiency are poor.

Two sample specifications are included, namely

1. sort.spec. Training inputs and evaluation function for generating
     a variety of sorting algorithms.

2. bst_del.spec. Training inputs and evaluation function for generating a 
     program that deletes an element from a binary search tree.

The files "run" and "heap" are modified versions of the run-time system
and heap for Standard ML of New Jersey version 110. Can be started in single
processor mode using the "sml" script. In order to start it under MPI,
please see genealogical_search.sml and figure it out yourself.

Modify the file "run.sml" in order to try an example. Then load it into
the Standard ML of New Jersey system with 

use "run.sml";

Cheers,
